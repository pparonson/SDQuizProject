## How to setup the derby database for this project:

1) Open a Terminal and cd to your SD/Databases directory

2) Run the following command:

startNetworkServer

3) Open another Terminal window, cd to the SD/Databases directory 
   and run the following command to start the ij program:

ij

4) Within the ij program, run this command to create the database:

connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/quiz;create=true'; 

5) Also within ij, run this command to populate the database (adjust the path as necessary):

run 'quizdb-derby.sql'; 

6) To verify that the previous command worked, run this command in ij:

select * from question;

7) To exit ij, simply use the exit command followed by a semicolon:

exit;

## If at some later date you wish to use ij to query the database, follow steps 1, 2, and 3
## to start Derby and ij, then do step 4 with a small modification:
##   connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/quiz';
